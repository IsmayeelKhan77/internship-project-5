##🛡️ Custom SIEM Dashboard using ELK Stack
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a custom Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) dashboard using the Elastic Stack (ELK).
The dashboard visualizes critical security events such as brute-force attacks, privilege escalations, and data exfiltration attempts to help detect suspicious activity in real time.

⚙️ Steps Completed

1. Data Ingestion:
Uploaded security log data into Kibana using the File Data Visualizer.
Created an index (siem_index) and data view for log analysis.

2. Data Visualization:
Built multiple visualizations in Kibana Lens:
Failed Login Attempts Over Time (to monitor brute-force attempts)
Privilege Escalation Events
Data Exfiltration Attempts
Login Success vs Failure Comparison

3. Dashboard Creation:
Combined all visualizations into a single SIEM Dashboard.
Added titles and descriptions for clarity.

🧠 Key Learnings
Hands-on experience with Elastic Stack for log ingestion and visualization.
Understanding of SIEM principles and how to detect real-world attack patterns.
Improved ability to analyze and interpret security data visually.
